HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but  "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an exten sion to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.
